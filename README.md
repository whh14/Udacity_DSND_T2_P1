Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program, Term 2 Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post


## Installation
The jupyter notebook file (udacity_airbnb.ipynb) was completed with python 3.6.8. To run the file, You would need to download and save the data files (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/kernels) to the same directory 

## File descriptions
  README.md : 
  udacity_airbnb.ipynb : Jupyter notebook file contains the investigation, analysis and results of the Seattle Airbnb open data

## Project Motivation
This Github repository contain the jupyter notebook file requires as part of the Project 1, term 2 of the Udacity data Data Scientist Nanodegree program.  The tile of the project is referred to as "Write a Data Science Blog Post".  The key tasks for this project are to (1) pick and analysis a dataset following the CRISP-DM process (2) pose and answer (at least) three questions relate to the dataset.  The analysis would be shown in a Jupyter notebook (this file) saved in Github repos and results/findings also publish on a blog post. 

The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining process) refers to the common practices that data scientist applied in solving real life problem.  It has six major phases,

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding 
3. Prepare Data
4. Data Modelling
5. Evaluate the results
6. Deploy

This project is written following the CRISP-DM process. 

## Results

In short it is a worth while practice to analysis Seattle Airbnb open data (or other Airbnb database that is relevant to your area) no mater if you are a host or a guest. In this blog, we have shown that there are both seasonal and weekly variation trends in the rental prices. The average occupancy in the Seattle area is 32%, but not all listings are equal. Only a few listings are book more than 50% of time. Although there is no direct relationship between host response rate and review score rating. But it is absolutely necessary for the hosts to put an good amount of effort into the job. Guests value their privacy and preferred a more relaxed host.

The blog post component of the project would be found at
